Welcome to the wis Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

To run this app, well, we will see what it takes

Things I did
found the offending lodash file and saw it was truncated in a comment so I ended 
the comment. That did not do it so I renamed that lodash file
and copied a good one from elsewhere. So then my next error came on flatten.
There are more google hits for that error, so let's see...

I removed
dist
from .gitignore

one idea is to do 

npm cache clean
and then reinstall "stuff" (not sure what or how)
this is hard!!
